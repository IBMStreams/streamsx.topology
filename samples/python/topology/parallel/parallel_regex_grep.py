    """
    Sample continuous (streaming) regular expression grep topology application.
    This Python application builds a simple topology that periodically polls a 
    directory for files, reads each file and output lines that match a regular
    expression.
    The matching is done on a stream parallelized into 5 parallel channels.
    Tuples are routed to parallel channels such that an even distribution is
    maintained.
    
    Args:
        directory (string): a directory that contains files to process
        search_pattern (string): a search pattern
        
    Example:
        * In addition to including the `com.ibm.streamsx.topology/opt/python/packages`
          directory in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, also include the
          `samples/python/topology/simple` directory.
        * Create a subdirectory "dir"
        * Create file1.txt in subdirectory "dir" with the following contents:
            file1 line1
            file1 line2
            file1 line3
        * Create file2.txt in subdirectory "dir" with the following contents:
            file2 line1
            file2 line2
            file2 line3
        * python3 parallel_regex_grep.py dir line[1-2]
        
    Example Output (intermixed):
        file2 line1
        file2 line2
        file1 line1
        file1 line2
