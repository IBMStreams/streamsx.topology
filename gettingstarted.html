	              <h3>Java Application API Getting Started Guide</h3>
        <p>
        The Java Application API allow you to write IBM Streams application in Java.  In this guide, we are going to show:
<ul>
<li>How to install the Java Application API</li>
<li>Setting up samples project in Eclipse</li>
<li>How to run a sample</li>
<li>How to monitor the running Streams application</li>
</ul>        

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You can try out this feature in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Streams Quick Start Edition VM</li>
<li>Manual Installation of the Java Application API</li>
</ol>   

<h3>Streams Quick Start Edition VM</h3>
<p>Getting Streams Quick Start Edition VM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Streams Quick Start Edition VM image here:  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/stream-computing/trials.html"> IBM InfoSphere Streams 4.0 Java API Beta QuickStart VM Image</a></li>
<li>Extract and use a VM player of your choice to play the VM image</li>
</ol>   

<p>The VM image has the com.ibm.streamsx.topology toolkit installed.  The toolkit is located at:
/home/streamsadmin/streamx.topology/streamsx.topology-v&lt;build id>/  
</p>
<p> 
This directory contains two sub-directories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>com.ibm.streamsx.topology - the topology toolkit that enables you to write your Streams application in Java</li>
<li>samples - a set of samples that demonstrate the Java Application APIs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Importing out Samples in Eclipse</h4>
<p>To try out the samples, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Double click on the <b>InfoSphere Streams Studio (Eclipse)</b> icon on the desktop to start Streams Studio.</li>
<li>When prompted for a workspace, specify this as the workspace to open:  <b>/home/streamsadmin/Workspaces/topology/ </b> </li>
</ol>

<h3>Manual Installation</h3> 
<p>If you already have a Streams v4.x installation, you can manually install this toolkit.</p>
<ol>  
<li>Download the latest release from here:  <a href="https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.topology/releases"></li>
<li>Unzip the streamsx.topology*.tar.gz file onto the file system.</li>
<li>Start Eclipse / Streams Studio.</li>
<li>Set up classpath variable in your workspace:</li>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables</li>
<li>Click New...</li>
<li>In the New Variable Entry dialog, provide a name for the library.  I put mine as "STREAMS_JAVA_FUNCTIONAL_API".</li>
<li>Click File…</li>
<li>Browse to locate the following file:  &lt;streamsx.topology install path>/com.ibm.streamsx.topology/lib/com.ibm.streamsx.topology.jar</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>This completes the installation of the streamsx.topology project.
The steps above are specific to installing the toolkit in Eclipse or Streams Studio.  You may use other tooling of your choice.  
In that case, make sure the following jar files are part of the classpth:
<ul>
<li>&lt;streamsx.topology install path>/com.ibm.streamsx.topology/lib/com.ibm.streamsx.topology.jar</li>
<li>$STREAMS_INSTALL/lib/com.ibm.streams.operator.samples.jar</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Importing samples in Eclipse</h4>
<ol>
<li>File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace</li>
<li>Browse to <streamsx.topology_install_location>/samples/java/functional directory as the root to import.</li>
<li>Select JavaFunctionalAPISamples. </li>
<li>Select Copy projects into workspace</li>
</ol>
This will import the sample project into your workspace.  The project expect a classpath variable named STREAMS_JAVA_FUNCTIONAL_API.  Follow the steps from previous section to define this classpath variable.

<h3>Exploring the Samples</h3>
<p>
The Java Application API contains a number of samples to help you learn the API.
For a list of all samples available, refer to this page:  <a href="http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/doc/samples/javadoc/index.html">Java Application APIs Samples</a>
</p>

<h3>Running the Samples</h3>

Before you can run the samples, you need to set up the Streams environment.  Follow these steps to set up the Streams environment.
<h4>Setting up Streams Runtime Environment</h4>
<ol>
<li>Set up Streams environment by running the streamsprofile.sh.</li>
<p>Go to $STREAMS_INSTALL/bin directory and run the following command: </p>
    <p><code>source streamsprofile.sh</code></p>
<li>Set STREAMS_ZKCONNECT environment - This is the Zookeeper ensemble to be used by Streams.</li>
<li>Follow this guide to create a domain and an instance:  <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/streams-quick-start-guide/#streams_domain_and_instance">Streams Quick Start Guide</a> </li>
<li>Set the following environments.  These environments are used for the Java Application APIs to determine the domain and instance to use when application is launched in distributed mode.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> STREAMS_DOMAIN - Streams domain to launch a distributed application to</li>
        <li> STREAMS_INSTANCE - Streams instance to launch a distributed application to</li>
    </ul>    
</ol>
<p>
You can run the sample like any Java application in Eclipse.  To run the samples:
<ol>
<li> Create a new Java launch configuration of the sample that you want to run.  For example, if you would like to run the 
Vwap sample, create a Java launch configuration for the Vwap class.</li>
<li>In the Java launch configuration dialog, open the Arguments.</li>
<li>In the Arguments, specify one of the following values as the Program Arguments</li>
    <ul>
    <li>EMBEDDED - Run the application in embedded mode.  This is a simulated Java environment for running your Streams application.</li>
    <li>STANDALONE - Run the application in stand alone mode.  When running in this mode, SPL code will be generated based on your Streams topology.  The SPL application is then
      compiled as a Standalone application.  The application runs as a single process.</li>
    <li>DISTRIBUTED - Run the application in distributed mode.  When running in this mode, SPL code will be generated based on your Streams topology.  The SPL application
      is compiled in Distributed mode and therefore the application can be submitted to a Strams instance.</li>
    <ul>
</ol> 
</p>

<h3>Monitoring your Streams Application</h3>

<p>If you have launched your job as DISTRIBUTED, you can monitor your running job using the Streams Console.
To open the Streams Console:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run this command at the command line: 
<p> <code> streamstool geturl </code> </p>
<p>This should return the URL of the Streams Console for your domain.</p></li>
<li>Open the browser with the URL.</li>
<li>You will be prompted for an user ID and password.  If you are using the Streams Quick Start VM, use streamsAdmin:passw0rd.</li> 
</ol>

<p>
If you have Streams Studio installed, you may also see the running job in Streams Explorer view and Instance Graph.
