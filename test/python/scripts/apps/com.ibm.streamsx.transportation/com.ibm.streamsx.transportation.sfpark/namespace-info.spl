/**
 * Integration of SFpark with IBM Streams.
 * 
 * SFpark ([http://sfpark.org/]) provides parking data for parking spaces in
 * San Francisco, California. 
 * Terms and conditions for use of the service are documented here:
 * [http://sfpark.org/sfpark-org-terms-of-use/]
 * 
 * SFpark encourages independent developers and researchers to use its public API, open data and open source
 * code to create new apps and data visualizations that support the projectâ€™s goal of making parking more readily available.
 * 
 * Note the [http://sfpark.org/developer-faqs/|Developer FAQ] says:
 * 
 * Q: How often can I call the API?
 * 
 * A: There are currently no limits on the use of the API service. However, please be mindful that it is a shared resource
 * and throttling may occur if usage is at unacceptable levels. We recommend that you call the service no more than once per minute.
 *
 * The full description of the open data is at:
 * [http://sfpark.org/how-it-works/open-data-page/].
 * 
 * # Java Application API for SFpark data
 * 
 * The Java package `com.ibm.streamsx.transportation.sfpark` provides Java classes representing parking spaces
 * and the `SFParkStreams` class that provides utility methods to create streams using the
 * [http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.topology/|IBM Streams Java Application API].
 * 
 * **Note:** *Currently the code is present but not yet tied into a build or has javadoc created
 * for it, thus it is currently a work in progress.*
