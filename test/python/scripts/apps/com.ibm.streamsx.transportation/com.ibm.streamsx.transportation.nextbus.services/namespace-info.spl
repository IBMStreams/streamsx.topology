/**
 * Microservices for NextBusÂ®.
 *
 * * [AgencyLocationsService] - Publishes a stream of NextBus vehicle location data including idle detection. Any number of this microservice can be submitted with a different agency set as a submission time value. Note though that NextBus has restrictions on data volume and frequency of requests which may be exceeded if a number are run on the same host.
 * * [MapBusLocations] - Subscribes to streams of bus locations published by [AgencyLocationsService] and an publishes a stream of locations suitable for mapping by [com.ibm.streamsx.transportation.mapping.services::MappingService]. The published stream contains a marker related to the speed or idle state of the bus and puts the marker in a layer specific to the agency. Typically only a single copy of this service is required.
 *
 * A simple demo may be setup by submitting one or more [AgencyLocationsService]
 * services, a single [MapBusLocations] service and a single
 * [com.ibm.streamsx.transportation.mapping.services::MappingService] service.
 * The default map provided by `HTTPTupleView` will concurrently include live
 * positions of vehicles for each agency with an [AgencyLocationsService] service.
