/**
 * [HTTPTupleView] provides default mapping visualization of
 * tuple data that contains latitude and longitude.
 * Each tuple in the window represents an object to be mapped
 * and must include these attributes (as SPL or JSON attributes):
 * * `id` - A unique identifier for the object being mapped. The identifier must be unique within its layer.
 * * `float64 longitude` - Longitude of the object's location.
 * * `float64 latitude` - Latitude of the object's location.
 *
 * These attributes are optional:
 * * `layer` - Identifier for the layer the item will be placed on. If not set a default layer of `Markers` is used. Type is `rstring` or `ustring`.
 * * `markerType` - Marker used at the item's position on the map. Can be of type [MarkerType] or an `rstring` containing the enumeration's values (e.g. `GREEN`) or a path to an icon file. If this attribute is not present in the tuple then `BLUE` is used.
 * * `note` - HTML for the popup that appears when the item's position marker is clicked. If this attribute is not present then the popup contains a string representation of the tuple.
 * 
 * When `markerType` is an path to an icon file there are three options:
 * * A path within a context specified by the `context` parameters. Note that any context can be used as long as the operator that specifies it has been fused with the [HTTPTupleView] operator and is using the same `port`. For example the `com.ibm.streamsx.transportation` toolkit might provide an [WebContext] operator that defines a `streamsx.transportation` context containing bus icon at `/streamsx.transportation/icons/bus.png`.
 * * A path within the application's default context which maps to `application_dir/opt/html`. For example if the application directory contains `opt/html/icons/drone.png` then the path `/icons/drone.png` will map to that icon.
* * A external URL.
 *
 * Access to the map is provided by the auto visualization table
 * located at the URL `streamsx.inet.resources/dojo/viewall.html`.
 * Locate the link in the table corresponding to the input port
 * containing the mappable data.
 *
 * Mapping is provided using `http://www.openlayers.org/api/OpenLayers.js` thus 
 * internet connectivity is required to use the default mapping.
 * Note only when the mapping is accessed through its URLs
 * is internet connectivity required.
