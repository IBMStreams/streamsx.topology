/**
 * Declares a window of tuples for a {@link TStream}. Logically a {@code Window}
 * represents an continuously updated ordered list of tuples according to the
 * criteria that created it. For example {@link TStream#last(int) s.last(10)}
 * declares a window that at any time contains the last ten tuples seen on
 * stream {@code s}, while
 * {@link TStream#last(long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) s.last(5,
 * TimeUnit.SECONDS)} is a window that always contains all tuples present on stream
 * {@code s} in the last five seconds.
 * <P>
 * Typically windows are keyed which means the window's configuration
 * is independently maintained for each key seen on the stream.
 * For example with a window created using {@link TStream#last(int) last(3)}
 * then each key has its own window containing the last
 * three tuples with the same key.
 * <BR>
 * A window is keyed if it is created from a {@link TKeyedStream} 
 * or using {@link #key(Function)} or {@link #key()} on another window.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            Tuple type, any instance of {@code T} at runtime must be
 *            serializable.
 * @param <K> Key type.
