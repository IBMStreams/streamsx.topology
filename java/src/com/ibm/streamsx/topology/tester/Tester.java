/**
 * A {@code Tester} adds the ability to test a topology in a test
 * framework such as JUnit. 
 * 
 * The main feature is the ability to capture tuples from a
 * {@link TStream} in order to perform some form of verification
 * on them. There are two mechanisms to perform verifications:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link Condition} - Provides the ability to check if a common pattern is {@link Condition#valid() valid}, such as did the stream
 * produce the {@link #tupleCount(TStream, long) correct number of tuples}.</LI>
 * <LI>{@link Tester#splHandler(SPLStream, StreamHandler)  StreamHandler} - Provides the ability
 * to add an arbitrary handler to a stream, that will be called for every tuple on the stream. A number of implementations of
 * {@code StreamHandler} are in the {@code com.ibm.streams.flow.handlers} provided by the IBM Streams Java Operator API.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * The stream being verified must not be connected, but may have multiple conditions or handlers added.
 * <BR>
 * Currently, only streams that are instances of {@link SPLStream} or {@code TStream<String>} can have conditions
 * or handlers attached.
 * <P>
 * A {@code Tester} only modifies its {@link Topology} if the topology
 * is submitted to a tester {@link StreamsContext}, of type
 * {@link com.ibm.streamsx.topology.context.StreamsContext.Type#EMBEDDED_TESTER},
 * {@link com.ibm.streamsx.topology.context.StreamsContext.Type#STANDALONE_TESTER},
 * {@link com.ibm.streamsx.topology.context.StreamsContext.Type#DISTRIBUTED_TESTER}.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * When running a test using {@link com.ibm.streamsx.topology.context.StreamsContext.Type#STANDALONE_TESTER}
 * or {@link com.ibm.streamsx.topology.context.StreamsContext.Type#DISTRIBUTED_TESTER} a TCP server is setup
 * within the JVM running the test (e.g. the JVM running the JUnit tests} and the topology is modified to
 * send tuples from streams being tested to the TCP server. The port used by the TCP server is in the
 * ephemeral port range.
 * </P>
