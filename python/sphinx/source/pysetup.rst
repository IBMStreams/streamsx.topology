IBM Streams Python setup
########################

***************
Developer setup
***************

Developers install the `streamsx` package Python Package Index (PyPI) to
use this functionality::

    pip install streamsx

If already installed upgrade to the latest version is recommended::

   pip install --upgrade streamsx

A local install of IBM Streams is **not** required when:

    * Using the Streams and Streaming Analytics REST bindings :py:mod:`streamsx.rest`.
    * Devloping and submitting streaming applications using :py:mod:`streamsx.topology.topology` to the Streaming Analytics service on IBM Cloud.
        * The environment variable ``JAVA_HOME`` must reference a Java 1.8 JRE or JDK/SDK.

A local install of IBM Streams is required when:

    * Developing and submitting streaming applications using :py:mod:`streamsx.topology.topology` to the IBM Streams distributed or standalone contexts.
        * If set the environment variable ``JAVA_HOME`` must reference a Java 1.8 JRE or JDK/SDK, otherwise the Java install from ``$STREAMS_INSTALL/java`` is used.
    * Creating SPL Python primitive operators using :py:mod:`streamsx.spl.spl` decorators.

.. warning::
   When using the `streamsx` package ensure that the environment variable
   ``PYTHONPATH`` does **not** include a path ending with
   ``com.ibm.streamsx.topology/opt/python/packages``.
   The IBM Streams environment configuration script ``streamsprofile.sh``
   modifies or sets ``PYTHONPATH`` to include the Python support
   from the SPL topology toolkit shipped with the product. This was to
   support Python before the `streamsx` package was available. The
   recommendation is to unset ``PYTHONPATH`` or modify it not to
   include the path to the topology toolkit.

.. note::
   The `streamsx` package is self-contained and does not depend on any
   SPL topology toolkit (``com.ibm.streamsx.topology``) installed
   under ``$STREAMS_INSTALL/toolkits`` or on the SPL compiler's (``sc``)
   toolkit path. This is true at SPL compilation time and runtime.

***************************
Streaming Analytics service
***************************

The service instance has Anaconda 4.1 installed with Python 3.5 as the
runtime environment and has ``PYTHONHOME`` Streams application environment variable
pre-configured.

Any streaming applications using Python must use Python 3.5 when
submitted to the service instance.

**********************
IBM Cloud Pak for Data
**********************

An IBM Streams service instance within Cloud Pak for Data has Anaconda installed with Python 3.6 as the
runtime environment and has ``PYTHONHOME`` Streams application environment variable pre-configured.

Any streaming applications using Python must use Python 3.6 when
submitted to the service instance.

Streaming applications can be submitted through Jupyter notebooks running in
Cloud Pak for Data projects. The `streamsx` package is preinstalled and applications are sumitted to the :py:const:`~streamsx.topology.context.ContextTypes.DISTRIBUTED` context.

***********************
IBM Streams on-premises
***********************

For a distributed cluster running Streams Python 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6 may
be used.

Anaconda or Miniconda distributions may be used as the Python runtime, these have the advantage of being pre-built and including a number of standard packages.
Ananconda installs may be downloaded at: https://www.continuum.io/downloads .

.. note::
    When used by a distributed cluster a distribution matching
    the required Python 2.7, 3.5 or 3.6 release must be used, rather
    than a conda environment.

If building Python from source then it must be built to support embedding
of the runtime with shared libraries (``--enabled-shared`` option to `configure`).

Distributed
===========

For distributed the Streams application environment variable
``PYTHONHOME`` must be set to the Python install path.

This is set using `streamtool` as::

    streamtool setproperty --application-ev PYTHONHOME=path_to_python_install

The application environment variable may also be set using the Streams
console. The `Instance Management` view has an
`Application Environment Variables` section. Expanding the details
for that section allows modification of the set of environment
variables available to Streams applications.

The Python install path must be accessible on every application resource
that will execute Python code within a Streams application.

.. note::
   The Python version used to declare and submit the application must match the setting of ``PYTHONHOME`` in the instance. For example, if ``PYTHONHOME`` Streams application instance variable points to a Python 3.6 install, then Python 3.6 must be used to declare and submit the application.

Standalone
==========

The environment ``PYTHONHOME`` must be set to the Python install path.
