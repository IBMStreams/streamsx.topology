*****************************************
Controlling a Streaming Analytics service
*****************************************

The Streaming Analytics service to control is defined using
``--service-name SERVICE_NAME``. If not provided then the
service name is defined by the environment variable
``STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE_NAME``.

The named service must exist in the VCAP services definition
pointed to by the ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variable.

The response from making the control request is printed to
standard out in JSON format. By default a minimal response
is printed including the status of the service and the job count.
The complete response from the service REST API is printed if
the option ``--full-response`` is given.
