<div class="p">
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"> <tt class="ph tt">source(self, func)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Topology</tt>
<p class="p">  Fetches information from an external system and presents that information as a stream.   Takes a zero-argument callable that returns an iterable of tuples.   Each tuple that is not None from the iterator returned   from iter(func()) is present on the returned stream.
</p>

<p class="p">  param <tt class="ph tt">func</tt>: A zero-argument callable that returns an iterable of tuples.   A tuple is represented as a Python object that must be picklable.
</p>

<p class="p">  return: A Stream whose tuples are the result of the output obtained by invoking the provided callable.
</p>
</li>

<li class="li">
<p class="p"> <tt class="ph tt">subscribe(self, topic, schema=CommonSchema.Python)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Topology</tt>
</p>

<p class="p">  Subscribe to a topic published by IBM Streams applications.   A Streams application may publish a stream to allow other   applications to subscribe to it. A subscriber matches a   publisher if the topic and schema match.
</p>

<p class="p">  schema defaults to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.Python</tt> which subscribes to streams   published by Python applications where the stream contains Python objects.
</p>

<p class="p">  Setting schema to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.Json</tt> subscribes to streams of   JSON objects published by IBM Streams applications. JSON is used   as a common interchange format between all languages supported   by IBM Streams, including SPL, Java, Scala and Python.
</p>

<p class="p">  Setting schema to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.String</tt> subscribes to streams of   strings published by IBM Streams applications. String is used   as a common interchange format between all languages supported   by IBM Streams, including SPL, Java, Scala and Python.
</p>

<p class="p">  Setting schema to any other SPL schema subscribes to streams   with the matching SPL tuple type published by IBM Streams applications.   In general this will be SPL applications though Java and Scala applications   can publish streams with an SPL schema.  In Python tuples will   be transformed into a Python dictionary object (based on the schema).   Each tuple attribute will be converted into an appropriate Python type and added to the    Python dictionary object using the name of the attribute as the dictionary key value. 
</p>

<div class="p">  Supported SPL types and resultant Python types are: 
<pre class="pre codeblock">
int8,int16,int32,int64 : int
uint8,uint16,uint32,uint64 : int
float32,float64 : float
rstring : str
ustring : str
boolean : boolean
list : list
map : dictionary

</p>

<p class="p">  Filters tuples from a stream using the supplied callable <tt class="ph tt">func</tt>.   For each tuple on the stream the callable is called passing   the tuple, if the callable return evalulates to true the   tuple will be present on the returned stream, otherwise   the tuple is filtered out.
</p>

<p class="p">  param <tt class="ph tt">func</tt>: A callable that takes a single parameter for the tuple, and returns True or False.   If True, the tuple is included on the returned stream.  If False, the tuple is filtered out.   The callable is invoked for each incoming tuple.

<p class="p"> <tt class="ph tt">multi_transform(self, func)</tt> or <tt class="ph tt">flat_map(self, func)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Stream</tt>
</p>

<p class="p">  Transforms each tuple from this stream into 0 or more tuples using the supplied callable <tt class="ph tt">func</tt>.    For each tuple on this stream, the returned stream will contain all non-None tuples from   the iterable.   Tuples will be added to the returned stream in the order the iterable   returns them.   If the return is None or an empty iterable then no tuples are added to   the returned stream.
</p>

<p class="p">  param <tt class="ph tt">func</tt>: A callable that takes a single parameter for the tuple, and returns an iterable of tuples or None.   The callable must return an iterable or None, otherwise a TypeError is raised.   The callable is invoked for each incoming tuple.

<li class="li">
<p class="p"> <tt class="ph tt">isolate(self)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Stream</tt>

</p>
</li>

<li class="li">

<li class="li">

</p>

<p class="p">  Parallelizes the stream into <tt class="ph tt">width</tt> parallel channels.   Tuples are routed to parallel channels such that an even distribution is maintained.   Each parallel channel can be thought of as being assigned its own thread.   As such, each parallelized stream function are separate instances and operate independently from one another.
</p>

<p class="p">  <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> will only parallelize the stream operations performed after the call to <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> and before the call to <tt class="ph tt">end_parallel</tt>
</p>

<p class="p">  Parallel regions aren't required to have an output stream, and thus may be used as sinks.   In other words, a parallel sink is created by calling <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> and creating a sink operation.   It is not necessary to invoke <tt class="ph tt">end_parallel</tt> on parallel sinks.
</p>

<p class="p">  Nested parallelism is not currently supported.   A call to <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> should never be made immediately after another call to <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> without having an <tt class="ph tt">end_parallel</tt> in between.
</p>

<p class="p">  Every call to <tt class="ph tt">end_parallel</tt> must have a call to <tt class="ph tt">parallel</tt> preceding it.

</p>

<div class="p">  param: <tt class="ph tt">routing</tt> - denotes what type of tuple routing to use.

</ul>

</div>

<p class="p">  param: <tt class="ph tt">func</tt> - (Optional) Function called when HASH_PARTIONED routing is specified. The function provides an int32 value to be used as the hash that determines the tuple routing to downstream operators

</li>

<li class="li">
<p class="p"> <tt class="ph tt">end_parallel(self)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Stream</tt>

<p class="p"> <tt class="ph tt">publish(self, topic, schema=schema.CommonSchema.Python)</tt> function on <tt class="ph tt">Stream</tt>
</p>

<p class="p">  Publish this stream on a topic for IBM Streams applications to subscribe to.   A Streams application may publish a stream to allow other   applications to subscribe to it. A subscriber matches a   publisher if the topic and schema match.
</p>

<p class="p">  schema defaults to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.Python</tt> which publishes    the stream as Python objects.
</p>

<p class="p">  Setting schema to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.Json</tt> publishes the stream   as JSON objects. Each tuple (a Python object) is converted using   <tt class="ph tt">json.dumps</tt>. Note that each tuple object ype on the stream must   be able to be converted to JSON.   JSON is used as a common interchange format between all languages supported   by IBM Streams, including SPL, Java, Scala and Python.
</p>

<p class="p">  Setting schema to <tt class="ph tt">CommonSchema.String</tt> publishes the stream   as strings. Each tuple (a Python object) is converted using   <tt class="ph tt">str()</tt>.   String is used as a common interchange format between all languages supported   by IBM Streams, including SPL, Java, Scala and Python.
