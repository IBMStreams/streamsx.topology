Integration of SPL operators.

**********************
Invoking SPL Operators
**********************

IBM Streams supports *Stream Processing Language* (SPL),
a domain specific language for streaming analytics.
SPL creates an application by building a graph of operator
invocations. These operators are declared in an SPL toolkit.

SPL streams have a structured schema, such as
``tuple<rstring id, timestamp ts, float64 value>`` for
a sensor reading with a sensor identifier, timestamp and value.
A schema is defined using :py:class:`~streamsx.topology.schema.StreamSchema`.

A Python topology application can take advantage of SPL operators
by using streams with structured schemas. A stream of Python objects
can be converted to a structured stream using
:py:meth:`~streamsx.topology.topology.Stream.map`
with the `schema` parameter set::

    # s is stream of Python objects representing a sensor
    s = ...
    
    # map s to a structured stream using a lambda function
    # for each sensor reading r a Python tuple is created
    # with the required values matching the order of the
    # structured schema.
    s2 = s.map(lambda r : (r.sensor_id, r.reading_time, r.reading),
         schema='tuple<rstring id, timestamp ts, float64 value>'

An SPL operator is invoked in an application by creating an
instance of:

 * :py:class:`Invoke` - Invocation of an arbitrary SPL operator.
 * :py:class:`Source` - Invocation of an SPL source operator with one input port.
 * :py:class:`Map` - Invocation of an SPL map operator with one input port and one output port.
 * :py:class:`Sink` - Invocation of an SPL sink operator with one output port.

In SPL, operator invocation supports a number of clauses that are
supported in Python.

.. _values_for_operator_clauses:

Values for operator clauses
---------------------------
When an operator clause requires a value, the value may be passed as
a constant,
an input attribute (passed using the `attribute` method of the invocation),
or an arbitrary SPL expression (passed as a string or an :py:class:`Expression`).
Because a string is interpreted as an SPL expression, a string constant
should be passed by enclosing the quoted string in outer quotes
(for example, '"a string constant"').

SPL is strictly typed so when passing a constant as a parameter value the
value may need to be strongly typed.
    * ``bool``, ``int``, ``float`` and ``str`` values map automatically to SPL `boolean`, `int32`, `float64` and `rstring` respectively.
    * ``Enum`` values map to an operator custom literal using the symbolic name of the value. For custom literals only the symbolic name needs to match a value expected by the operator, the class name and other values are arbitrary.
    * The module :py:mod:`streamsx.spl.types` provides functions to create typed SPL expressions from values.

Param clause
------------
Operator parameterization is through operator parameters that configure
and modify the operator for the specific application.

Parameters are passed as a `dict` containing the parameter names and their values (see :ref:`values_for_operator_clauses`).

*Examples*

To invoke a `Beacon` operator from the SPL standard toolkit producing 100 tuples at the rate of two per second::

    schema = StreamSchema('tuple<uint64 seq>')
    beacon = op.Source(topology, 'spl.utility::Beacon', schema,
        params = {'iterations':100, 'period':0.5})

To use an ``IntEnum`` to pass a custom literal to the ``Parse`` operator::

    from enum import IntEnum

    class DataFormats(IntEnum):
        csv = 0
        txt = 1

    ...

    params['format'] = DataFormats.csv
    

To create a `count` parameter of type `uint64` for the SPL `DeDuplicate` operator::

    params['count'] = streamsx.spl.types.uint64(20)

After the instance representing the operator
invocation has been created, additional parameters may be added through
the `params` attribute. If the value is an expression that is only valid
in the context of the operator invocation then the parameter must be added
after the operator invocation has been created.

For example, the `Filter` operator uses an expression that is usually dependent on the context, filtering tuples based upon their attribute values::

    fs = op.Map('spl.relational::Filter', beacon)
    fs.params['filter'] = fs.expression('seq % 2ul == 0ul')

Output clause
-------------

The operator output clause defines the values of attributes on outgoing
tuples on the operator invocation's output ports.

When a tuple is submitted by an operator invocation each of its attributes is
set in one of three ways:

    * By the operator based upon its state and input tuples. For example, a US ZIP code operator might set the `zipcode` attribute based upon its lookup of the ZIP code from the address details in the input tuple.
    * By the operator implicitly setting output attributes from matching input attributes. Many streaming operators implicitly set output attributes to allow attributes to flow through the operator without any explicit coding. This only occurs when an output attribute is not explicitly set by the operator or the output clause and the input tuple has an attribute that matches the name and type of the output attribute. For example in the US ZIP code operator if the output tuple included attributes of ``rstring city, rstring state`` matching input attributes then they would be implicitly copied from input tuple to output tuple.
    * By an output clause in the operator invocation. In this case the application invoking the operator is explicitly setting attributes using SPL expressions. An operator may provide output functions that return values based upon the operator's state and input tuples. For example, the US ZIP code operator might provide a ``ZIPCode()`` output function rather than explicitly setting an output attribute. Then the application is free to use any attribute name to represent the ZIP code in its output tuple.

In Python an output tuple attribute is set by creating an attribute in the operator invocation instance that is set to a return from the `output` method.
The attribute value passed to the `output` method is passed as described in
:ref:`values_for_operator_clauses`.

For example, invoking an SPL `Beacon` operator using an output function to set the sequence number of a tuple and an SPL expression to set the timestamp::

    schema = StreamSchema('tuple<uint64 seq, timestamp ts>')
    beacon = op.Source(topology, 'spl.utility::Beacon', schema, params = {'period':0.1})

    # Set the seq attribute using an output function provided by Beacon
    beacon.seq = beacon.output('IterationCount()')

    # Set the ts attribute using an SPL function that returns the current time
    beacon.ts = beacon.output('getTimestamp()')
