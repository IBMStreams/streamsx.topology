"""
IBM Streams supports *Stream Processing Language* (SPL),
a domain specific language for streaming analytics.
SPL creates an application by building a graph of operator
invocations. These operators are declared in a SPL toolkit.

SPL streams have a fixed schema, such as
``tuple<rstring id, timestamp ts, float64 value>`` for
a sensor reading with a sensor identifier, timestamp and value.

A Python topology application can take advantage of SPL operators
by using Streams with fixed SPL schemas.

class Invoke(exop.ExtensionOperator):
    """
    Declaration of an invocation of an SPL operator in a Topology.

    An SPL operator has an arbitrary of input ports and
    an arbitrary number of output ports. The kind of the
    operator places constraints on how many input and output
    ports it supports, and potentially the schemas for those
    ports. For example ``spl.relational::Filter`` has
    a single input port and one or two output ports,
    in addition the schemas of the ports must be identical.

    When the operator has output ports an instance of
    ``SPLOperator`` has an ``outputs`` attributes which
    is a list of ``Stream`` instances.

    Args:
        topology(Topology): Topology that will invoke the operator.
        kind(str): SPL operator kind, e.g. ``spl.utility::Beacon``.
        inputs: Streams to connect to the operator. If not set or set to
            ``None`` or an empty collection then the operator has no
             input ports. Otherwise a list or tuple of ``Stream`` instances
             where the number of items is the number of input ports.
        schemas: Schemas of the output ports. If not set or set to
            ``None`` or an empty collection then the operator has no
             outut ports. Otherwise a list or tuple of schemas
             where the number of items is the number of output ports.
