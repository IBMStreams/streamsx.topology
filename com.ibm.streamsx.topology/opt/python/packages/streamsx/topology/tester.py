Testing support for streaming applications.

********
Overview
********

Allows testing of a streaming application by creation conditions
on streams that are expected to become valid during the processing.
`Tester` is designed to be used with Python's `unittest` module.

A complete application may be tested or fragments of it, for example a sub-graph can be tested
in isolation that takes input data and scores it using a model.

Supports execution of the application on
:py:const:`~streamsx.topology.context.ContextTypes.STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE`,
:py:const:`~streamsx.topology.context.ContextTypes.DISTRIBUTED`
or :py:const:`~streamsx.topology.context.ContextTypes.STANDALONE`.

A :py:class:`Tester` instance is created and associated with the :py:class:`Topology` to be tested.
Conditions are then created against streams, such as a stream must receive 10 tuples using
:py:meth:`~Tester.tuple_count`.

Here is a simple example that tests a filter correctly only passes tuples with values greater than 5::

    import unittest
    from streamsx.topology.topology import Topology
    from streamsx.topology.tester import Tester

    class TestSimpleFilter(unittest.TestCase):

        def setUp(self):
            # Sets self.test_ctxtype and self.test_config
            Tester.setup_streaming_analytics(self)

        def test_filter(self):
            # Declare the application to be tested
            topology = Topology()
            s = topology.source([5, 7, 2, 4, 9, 3, 8])
            s = s.filter(lambda x : x > 5)

            # Create tester and assign conditions
            tester = Tester(topology)
            tester.contents(s, [7, 9, 8])

            # Submit the application for test
            # If it fails an AssertionError will be raised.
           tester.test(self.test_ctxtype, self.test_config)


A stream may have any number of conditions and any number of streams may be tested.

A :py:meth:`~Tester.local_check` is supported where a method of the
unittest class is executed once the job becomes healthy. This performs
checks from the context of the Python unittest class, such as
checking external effects of the application or using the REST api to
monitor the application.

A test fails-fast if any of the following occur:
    * Any condition fails. E.g. a tuple failing a :py:meth:`~Tester.tuple_check`.
    * The :py:meth:`~Tester.local_check` (if set) raises an error.
    * The job for the test:
        * Fails to become healthy.
        * Becomes unhealthy during the test run.
        * Any processing element (PE) within the job restarts.

A test timeouts if it does not fail but its conditions do not become valid.
The timeout is not fixed as an absolute test run time, but as a time since "progress"
was made. This can allow tests to pass when healthy runs are run in a constrained
environment that slows execution. For example with a tuple count condition of ten,
progress is indicated by tuples arriving on a stream, so that as long as gaps
between tuples are within the timeout period the test remains running until ten tuples appear.

.. note:: The test timeout value is not configurable.

.. note:: The submitted job (application under test) has additional elements (streams & operators) inserted to implement the conditions. These are visible through various APIs including the Streams console raw graph view. Such elements are put into the `Tester` category.

.. note::
    The package `streamsx.testing <https://pypi.org/project/streamsx.testing/>`_ provides `nose <https://pypi.org/project/nose>`_ plugins to provide control over tests without having to modify their source code.

.. versionchanged:: 1.9 - Python 2.7 supported (except with Streaming Analytics service).

        Creates a test condition that the tuples on a stream
        eventually reach a known result or state. Each tuple
        on `stream` results in a call to ``checker(tuple_)``.

        The return from `checker` is handled as:
            * ``None`` - The condition requires more tuples to become valid.
            * `true value` - The condition has become valid.
            * `false value` - The condition has failed. Once a condition has failed it can never become valid.

        Thus `checker` is typically stateful and allows ensuring that
        condition becomes valid from a set of input tuples. For example
        in a financial application the application under test may need
        to achieve a final known balance, but due to timings of windows the
        number of tuples required to set the final balance may be variable.

        Once the condition becomes valid any false value,
        except ``None``, returned by processing of subsequent
        tuples will cause the condition to fail.

        Returning ``None`` effectively never changes the state of the condition.

        A call to `callable` is made after the application under test is submitted and becomes healthy.
        The check is in the context of the Python runtime executing the unittest case,
        typically the callable is a method of the test case.

        The application remains running until all the conditions are met
        and `callable` returns. If `callable` raises an error, typically
        through an assertion method from `unittest` then the test will fail.

        Used for testing side effects of the application, typically with `STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE`
        or `DISTRIBUTED`. The callable may also use the REST api for context types that support
        it to dynamically monitor the running application.

        The callable can use `submission_result` and `streams_connection` attributes from :py:class:`Tester` instance
        to interact with the job or the running Streams instance.
        These REST binding classes can be obtained as follows:

            * :py:class:`~streamsx.rest_primitives.Job` - ``tester.submission_result.job``
            * :py:class:`~streamsx.rest_primitives.Instance` - ``tester.submission_result.job.get_instance()``
