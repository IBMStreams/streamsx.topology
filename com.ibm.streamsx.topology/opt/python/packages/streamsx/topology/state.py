Application state.

********
Overview
********

Stateful applications are ones that include callables that are classes and
thus can maintain state as instance variables.

By default any state is reset to its initial state after a
processing element (PE) restart. A restart may occur due to:

    * a failure in the PE or its resource,
    * a explicit PE restart request,
    * or a parallel region width change (IBM Streams 4.3 or later)

The application or a portion of it may be configured to maintain
state after a PE restart by one of two mechanisms.

    * Consistent region. A consistent region is a subgraph where the states of callables become consistent by processing all the tuples within defined points on a stream. After a PE restart all callables in the region are reset to the last consistent point, so that the state of all callables represents the processing of the same input tuples to the region.

        * :py:meth:`streamsx.topology.topology.Stream.set_consistent`
        * :py:class:`ConsistentRegionConfig`
        * `Consistent region overview <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCRJU_4.3.0/com.ibm.streams.dev.doc/doc/consistentregions.html>`_

    * Checkpointing, each stateful callable is checkpointed periodically and after a PE restart its callables are reset to their most recent checkpointed state.

        * :py:attr:`streamsx.topology.topology.Topology.checkpoint_period`

******************
Stateful callables
******************

Use of a class instance allows a transformation (for example :py:meth:`~streamsx.topology.topology.Stream.map`) to be stateful by maintaining state in instance
attributes across invocations.

When the callable is in a consistent region or checkpointing it is serialized using `dill`. The default serialization may be modified by using the standard Python pickle mechanism of ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__``.  This is required if the state includes objects that cannot be serialized, for example file descriptors. For details see See https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/pickle.html#handling-stateful-objects .

If the callable has ``__enter__`` and ``__exit__`` context manager methods then ``__enter__`` is called after the object has been deserialized by `dill`. Thus ``__enter__`` is used to recreate runtime objects that cannot be serialized such as open files or sockets.

    A :py:class:`ConsistentRegionConfig` configures a consistent region.
    
    The recommended way to create a :py:class:`ConsistentRegionConfig` is
    to call either :py:meth:`.operator_driven` or :py:meth:`.periodic`.
    
    Args:
        trigger(ConsistentRegionConfig.Trigger): Determines how the 
            drain/checkpoint cycle of the consistent region is triggered.

        period: The trigger period.  If the trigger is :py:const:`~ConsistentRegionConfig.Trigger.PERIODIC`, this must 
            be specified, otherwise it may not be specfied.  This may be 
            either a :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` value or the number of 
            seconds as a `float`.

        drain_timeout: Indicates the maximum time in seconds that the drain
            and checkpoint of the region is allotted to finish processing.
            If the process takes longer than the specified time, a failure
            is reported and the region is reset to the point of the
            previously successfully established consistent state. The value
            must be specified as either a
            :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` value or the number of seconds
            as a `float`.  If not specified, the default value is 180
            seconds.

        reset_timeout: Indicates the maximum time in seconds that the reset
            of the region is allotted to finish processing. If the process
            takes longer than the specified time, a failure is reported and
            another reset of the region is attempted.  The value must be
            specified  as either a :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` value or
            the number of seconds as a `float`.  If not specified, the
            default value is 180 seconds.

        max_consecutive_attempts(int): Indicates the maximum number of
            consecutive attempts to reset a consistent region. After a
            failure, if the maximum number of attempts is reached, the
            region stops processing new tuples. After the maximum number
            of consecutive attempts is reached, a region can be reset only
            with manual intervention or with a program with a call to a
            method in the consistent region controller.  This must be an
            integer value between 1 and 2147483647, inclusive.  If not
            specified, the default value is 5.

        # with a drain timeout of sixty seconds and a reset timeout of twenty seconds.
