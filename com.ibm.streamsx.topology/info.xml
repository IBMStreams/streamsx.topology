    <description>
Toolkit providing mechanisms to build IBM Streams
applications in other programming languages, with Java, Scala and Python support.

This is an **alpha version** that adds the ability to easily convert Python functions to SPL operators.

Java, Scala and SPL support is based upon the 1.1 release.

# Java
*Java Application API* - A library that allows the definition
and execution of streaming applications implemented in Java.
Applications use Java code to process tuples and tuples are Java objects.

See the documentation under `doc/javadoc/index.html` for details.
# Scala
*Scala Support* - The Java Application API supports applications written in Scala.

See the documentation under `doc/scaladoc/index.html` for details.

# SPL
*Topic based* [com.ibm.streamsx.topology.topic::Publish|Publish] and
[com.ibm.streamsx.topology.topic::Subscribe|Subscribe] operators
provide the mechanism to exchange streams between applications
regardles of the thier implementation language.
[compilationunit:com.ibm.streamsx.topology::types.spl|SPL types] are
provided that allow interchange with applications implemented
in other languages.

# Python - Alpha
*Python functions as SPL operators* - A Python function can be simply turned into an SPL operator to allow
tuple processing using Python.

*Python Application API* - A module that allows the definition
and execution of streaming applications implemented in Python.
Applications use Python code to process tuples and tuples are Python objects.

See the documentation under [namespace:com.ibm.streamsx.topology.python|com.ibm.streamsx.topology.python] for details.
